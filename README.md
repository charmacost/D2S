# [Destiny 2 Strategies](https://charmacost.github.io/D2S)
>**This will change a LOT so keep that in mind...**

# Welcome! 
D2S is my *new* overly-ambitious project which will likely never get finished!

# What is D2S?
D2S, also known as Destiny 2 Strategies is a personal project which aims to use the Destiny 2 API to list high-end PvE activities and then list off documents/articles on how to complete them.

# What languages are being used?
This project (as of now) will use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The problem is I don't know any of them.

# Conclusion
If you stumble upon this don't expect anything crazy right now, as I am a very early beginner getting my feet wet with a large project.
