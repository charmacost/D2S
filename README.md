**This will change a LOT so keep that in mind**

Welcome to my *new* overly-ambitious project

D2S, also known as Destiny 2 Strategies is a personal project which aims to use the Destiny 2 API to list high end PvE activities then list off document/articles on how to complete them

This project (as of now) will use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The problem is I don't know any of them.

If you stumble upon this don't expect anything crazy right now, as I am a very early beginner getting my feet wet with a large project.
